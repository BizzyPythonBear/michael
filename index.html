					<h3>Why I code</h3>
					<p>Before I ever started coding, I was always wondering how things worked, especially video games and software. I decided to find out how these applications, games, and etc, all worked. So, I googled, "how are games made?". And not soon after that I found out about coding. When I first saw code, It was really interesting because I didn't know what it was, and it also looked cool. So I looked up how to code and decided to learn python as my first language. I loved it, in fact, I still code in python to this day and it's by far one of my most favorite languages. So, really I code because it makes me happy, and it's super fascinating being able to communicate with a computer like you would to a person.</p>
